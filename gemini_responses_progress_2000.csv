As shown in Figure 1, a glass column with a diameter of 20 mm and length of 250 mm was employed as the reactor. The total volume of the reactor was 78 ml. A circulation pump was installed to maintain an upward flow of at least 50 m/h to fluidize CMA-chitosan. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was changed by varying the flow rate of the influent and effluent pumps. The solution pH was adjusted to the designated values by adding 0.1 N HCl and NaOH solutions to the reservoir of raw wastewater. The reservoir was magnetically stirred and maintained at desired temperature (4–45°C). H2O2 (0.02–1.02 mol/L) was added at once initiating the reaction. Effluent was withdrawn continuously from the top of the reactor, and 5 mL aliquots were withdrawn as sample at designated time intervals. It was mixed with 0.1 g MnO2 to eliminate residual H2O2 [3], and filtered using 0.22-μm membranes to analyze the reaction mixture. The effluent was withdrawn from a point about 3 cm above the circulation pump to avoid the carry over effect of CMA–chitosan.",,1.0,Ok?,Ok?,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,2.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,REQUESTED,REQUESTING_CONFIRMATION,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-04-09,09:30:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Requesting Confirmation, Level 3: Not Explicit, Level 4: None"

Outside I could see how nature had reached her arms around his house and gotten her fingers inside too.”  I liked that line too so I was happy when they pointed it out as a strength.  Another thing I learned is that although I think my group liked my story, I still don’t think it has that universal appeal aspect to it.  It was a nice romantic story, but so what.  I’m not sure it had any connection for them.  I could see them struggle with knowing what to say about it.  Now, that may have just been because we all barely knew each other, but I’m not sure.

She claims that appropriately written504 plans “level the playing field” by giving equal chances to succeed and access the same academic curriculum available to all children. Thus, educators need support in designing these plans and focus on approaches that work and create positive results, while weeding out approaches that have low success rates. Ms. Kennedy emphasized the importance of developing social and emotional skills in children who are deaf or hard of hearing, including advocacy skills from the earliest years. According to her and her colleagues, confidence is extremely important and it helps a child diffuse a negative situation when they are able to maintain a good attitude about it. Showing the bully confidence, being able to laugh off an insult, or remaining neutral to the assailant have been shown to deter some bullies. This also helps to keep the child in question mentally stable and emotionally healthy. Ms. Kennedy also stressed the importance of raising awareness about both bullying: there are some good predictors about which child may be targeted and how. Why not be proactive about using what we know to prevent bullying or stop it quickly?  and how to treat children who are disabled. She stated that it is important to be knowledgeable and to spread knowledge so that appropriate actions can be taken when need be. In addition, teachers need to be able to implement safety plans to ensure the physical and mental safety of the child being bullied. Bystander training is a promising newer angle to reduce bullying. She claimed that an important step in this process is to maintain consistent and regular communication with students that are prone to bullying to assess their individual situations. She also believes that more intensive and extended programs should be implemented to assist those who need it. Overall, Ms. Kennedy displayed a positive belief about the future possibilities of reducing incidences of bullying toward children who are deaf or hard of hearing, and indeed, all children with special needs. .",,1.0,"Every field has terms that go in and out of popularity, and “impaired” is currently out!","Every field has terms that go in and out of popularity, and “impaired” is currently out!",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,PROVIDED,CONTEXT,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-08-02,17:17:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Change"

Karol (2007) described preverbal experiences that children may exhibit as a result of trauma which involves a sense of touch, contact comfort, and rhythm. When the child is experiencing this phase, they will search for tactile and rhythmical comfort to keep from feeling further disorganized. The horse works as a co-therapist to ensure the client’s motivation to engage in therapy while learning and practicing how to care for the horse (Karol, 2007). In one study, researchers found a decline in anxiety disorders and behavioral difficulties among children and adolescents while participating in EAT (Holmes, Goodwin, Redhead, & Gilmour 2012). Vaulting is a form of EAT that has been used as a therapeutic intervention which involves gymnastics on horseback. Therapeutic vaulting is based on competitive vaulting such that the client rides the horse while performing stunts (Vidrine, Owen-Smith, & Faulkner 2002). Engaging in vaulting, the client develops empathy and respect for their horse companion that can be applied in the real world, body awareness, and organizational skills. Therapy taking place in a group setting enhanced trust amongst the clients (Vidrine, Owen-Smith, & Faulkner 2002).",2007,1.0,Great!,Great!,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,SOCIAL COMMUNICATION,FEEDBACK,CONTENT,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-08-01,14:11:00,"Level 0: Social Communication, Level 1: Acknowledgment, Level 2: None, Level 3: None, Level 4: None"

Evidence shows that most of the times the bully is within the social circle. However, due to lack of definitive proof, the victim is powerless. Cyberbullying is more frustrating to the person being bullied because one can never be sure if it is your next door neighbor or your closest friend who is bullying you. Unlike the other types of bullying, cyberbullying is a permanent form of bullying because once something posted on the internet, it remains accessible to all people at any time. Besides, social network platforms are familiar places where disclosure of private information, posting of abusive comments and spread of false rumor is rampant. When teenagers and adults alike spend more time on the internet, they are more acceptable to cyberbullying due to the excessive exposure to cyber bullies. The current situation will remain the same because as the new technology emerges, more sophisticated threats of online bullying emerge (Erdur-Baker, 2010).",,1.0,Inserted:  be,Inserted:  be,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add"

Evidence shows that most of the times the bully is within the social circle. However, due to lack of definitive proof, the victim is powerless. Cyberbullying is more frustrating to the person being bullied because one can never be sure if it is your next door neighbor or your closest friend who is bullying you. Unlike the other types of bullying, cyberbullying is a permanent form of bullying because once something posted on the internet, it remains accessible to all people at any time. Besides, social network platforms are familiar places where disclosure of private information, posting of abusive comments and spread of false rumor is rampant. When teenagers and adults alike spend more time on the internet, they are more acceptable to cyberbullying due to the excessive exposure to cyber bullies. The current situation will remain the same because as the new technology emerges, more sophisticated threats of online bullying emerge (Erdur-Baker, 2010).",,1.0,Inserted: ng,Inserted: ng,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add"

The rivers were considered the main input of PFHxS to the lake since some of the rivers mainly collect discharge water from bigger cities with local PFAS-related plants. The level of PFHxS in the lake has increased in the period 2009–2014 while levels of PFOA and PFOS have remained more or less the same, which may be an indication of increased direct use of PFHxS and/or PFHxS related substances (Ma et al., 2018).","Gewurst et al., 2016",2.0,"Please add this manuscript to the references section or perhaps it should be Gewurtz et al., 2013.","Please add this manuscript to the references section or perhaps it should be Gewurtz et al., 2013.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,REQUESTED,CONTENT,EXPLICIT,ADD,2018-03-29,12:03:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Requested, Level 2: Reference, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Add (or Change if ""Gewurtz et al., 2013"" is meant to replace something existing).

However, three important jobs had to be done before the migration. Besides the establishment of the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, making a great bell was also among three priorities of his agenda. Therefore, the bell was named the Great Bell of Yongle, which is now hung in the Big Bell Tower after over 500 years. The bell, 6.75m high and 3.4m wide, is as heavy as 46.5t. It is well protected with no break left but over 230,000 characters of religious texts inscribed, which would take a whole day to read them all. For instance, the Text of Buddha, the Sutra on Amida Buddha and Twelve Nidanas are inscribed at the external cover, Lotus Sutra in the internal side, Diamond Sutra at the bell lips and Nirvana Sutra at the top. What’s more, there are 17 Sanskrit sutras with most of them inscribed in Chinese and well distributed over the bell. Why did Emperor Yongle inscribe so many texts on such a great bell? To spread Buddhism? Of course not. He wanted to pray for those who were killed while conquering the nation. As the bell was heard, the texts were also heard, telling his people that the almighty Buddha was even praying for heroes of the nation and he was determined to create a peaceful and prosperous country for his people.",Nirvana,1.0,Nirvana Sutra是涅槃经，不是楞严咒。,Nirvana Sutra是涅槃经，不是楞严咒。,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,OTHER,,,,,2012-02-06,00:32:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Change

There are three mediating mechanisms which can forge the relationship between protest movement and social associations created by social media. These are the use of social media for access to news, its use as a forum for political expression and its use for promoting the cause and enhancing mobilization strategies.  (Valenzuela 2013) Added to this is the concept of what social media actually does, as opposed to the volume of it, or its prominence as a contemporary communications strategy.

The bell was usually knocked by 108 times, which is still done today. Why should it be knocked by 108 times? There are mainly two explanations. Firstly, there are 12 months, 24 solar terms and 72 pentads, and 108 knocks mean farewell to the past year and hello to the new year. Secondly, according to the Buddhist texts, there are 108 unhappiness for each human being, and 108 knocks are able to remove all of these unhappiness.

But those sciences (in the forms we have inherited them) might not have assumed that authority (in the ways that they have) and certain of our philosophies of science (as they have developed) may have disguised this fact from us (see Potter, 2006, Introduction). Taken together, a sense of the contingency of our ways of organising, practising, and understanding science are but one set among possible others. Moreover, the ways we have inherited are demonstrably not good ways for a variety of ethical and epistemic reasons.","Taken together, a sense of the contingency of our ways of organising, practising, and understanding science are but one set among possible others.

Atton asserts that this activity developed ‘a conception of the public sphere as an arena for dialogic praxis… and arena for radical inclusivity.’ (Atton 2004: 30) While Atton’s concentration was on Indymedia, the global collective of alternative online activists, this template is one that can be ascribed to the new social movements that construct alternative political spaces which interact with the wider public sphere. These portals provide a barrier free network for groups which aim to counter-balance their alienation from the mainstream media, but also import focal points of mobilization and ideological development. These spaces face inwards to facilitate meaningful internal communications while simultaneously providing an outward looking public identity. They present new forms of online media activism as ‘communicative democracy,’ developing the notion that, ‘it is the right of citizens to communicate what they like however hideous’, and the Internet provides a space to destabilize old modes of top down mainstream media communication and has ‘the capacity to transform the practice of journalism.’ (Atton 2004: 36-37) In this sense, ‘the Internet is fostering new opportunities for civic engagement, and, the new technology provides an environment most conducive to social movements with the organizational flexibility, resources and technical know-how to adapt.’ (Norris 2002: 212)",how,1.0,I’ve added a hyphen here to make this make sense – but is there one in the original?,I’ve added a hyphen here to make this make sense – but is there one in the original?,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2017-04-21,14:21:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Requesting Confirmation, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: None (While a change was made, the comment is primarily seeking confirmation about the original text.

The comment has two parts.  The first is a request to add information (when/how often teaching occurred). The second describes a section that has already been moved (executed change).

The purpose of this segmentation is to anticipate risks; business management can be done in a focused, efficient, and targeted according to the size of the business and business characteristics. The financing segmentation will affect the treatment and policy of the banks in determining the pricing, the adequacy of the collateral, the financing structure, and the authority to disconnect the financing. Meanwhile, financing customers can be grouped into five segments: corporate, commercial, business banking / small banking, micro, and consumer. The segmentation of each bank is different based on the size of the bank, but in principle is almost similar. Therefore, customer segmentation of cash loan and non-cash loan financing can be determined based on the following criteria: customer class, private business entity, Gross Annual Sales (GAS), financing limit, and financing purpose (consumptive or productive) (Ikatan Bankir Indonesia, 2014).","segmentation of each bank is different based on the size of the bank, but in principle",1.0,Deleted:by,Deleted:by,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2017-12-26,23:50:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Delete"

This aura of friendliness captivates you the moment you set foot on this beautiful land, where infrastructure such as roads and electricity are readily available. “We represent what we’d like to call Malaysian Hospitality”, remarked Azlan Ismail, President of PUMSA. “This is reflected in the accumulation of the three main races in Malaysia, the Chinese, the Indians and the Malays and each of these races bring their own culture in. As you mix those cultures together you get this feeling of warmth and friendliness.” The Malaysians here in Purdue are no different, in fact, they were extremely cooperative in organizing interviews and meet ups as I attempted to delve deeper into their culture and ideologies as a nation through PUMSA. Such is the amicability of Malaysians regardless of race. It is this same ideology that allows for the democracy to thrive in Malaysia. This is another commonality between Malaysia and PUMSA. In a democracy, potential leaders feel very strongly about giving their countrymen the right to decide who should be at the helm during the next term in office.

This comment proposes a discussion about whether to add a measured outcome to an overarching goal. It's a discussion about the document's content, and the suggested outcome (""increase survival by X % over baseline"") implies a potential *addition*.  Although other objectives might need to be changed to refer back to this new outcome, the main thrust of the comment is about adding the outcome itself.  The discussion needs to happen before any confirmed change, hence ""Potential Change""."

The core of the discussion revolves around potentially *adding* the specific outcome (""increase survival by X % over baseline"").

This feedback relates to the content of the document and suggests a potential need for change (likely to the limit itself), although no specific modification is explicitly requested.

Furthermore, recent restorations have also included community-based restoration (Short et al. 2002b), and modeling (Short et al. 2002a).

This comment provides instructional context and guidance. It anticipates potential student misconceptions (AM) and suggests prompts, including Big Picture Questions (BPQ), to address them. This falls under conveying pedagogical content and strategies, not requesting document modifications.  It's explaining how to handle student thinking during a lesson, not how to change the lesson plan or document itself."

to answer the potential investor's basic
questions.

The executive summary should be at the
beginning of the business plan and is typically
2-4 pages in length.
It should never exceed 5 pages.
The following questions should be answered:
• What does the company do?
• Describe your value creation pitch to
investors in no more than 50 words.
• How long has it been established?
What has been achieved already?
• Who owns the company and who manages
the business?
• What are the sales and profit levels for the
last three years (if appropriate) and those
forecast for the next three years?
• How much money does the company want
to raise and why?

The summary should outline the purpose
and aims of the business. It must address
the specific issues upon which the decision
to invest will be made. These points will
be considered in greater detail in the rest
of the business plan.

The summary should also include;
• the critical points of the financial
projections, such as maximum funding
requirements or break-even points
• the particular strengths of the business,
whether in its management, products
or market sector
• any events, such as the completion of
product development or licensing/regulatory
approvals, upon which the success of
the venture depends
• the major risk factors of the
proposed venture","Therefore this section should aim
to answer the potential investor's basic
questions.",1,1,15,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,PROVIDED,CONTEXT,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2010-08-23,14:31:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Requested, Level 2: Asking Details, Level 3: Explicit, Level 4: Add

In Musyarakah contract, Antonio explains that Musyarakah contract that is applied in Islamic banks consists of two types, namely: Musyarakah Ownership and Musyarakah Akad (Contract). Musharakah Ownership comes from the existence of inheritance, will, or other conditions that result in the ownership of an asset by two people or more.

This comment explains how to handle the defense date field on different thesis versions (white, indigo, and black covers), and what to do if corrections are made before the defense.

Confidence helps in almost every aspect of one’s day, and can help get somebody through challenges they face. Kidpower is a wonderful program that makes curriculum programs useful for groups of people whether it is a school, agency, or even just parents to follow. Kidpower helps kid to be confident in advocating for themselves in any situation needed, and to know the major flags of safety. When working with children ages fourteen through twenty one, approaches need to be taken differently, than when dealing with children at the age of five or younger. There is research and proof that Kidpower truly does make a difference; their website states that about thirty-one percent of children show that their knowledge of safety has improved over three months (Van der Zande, 1). Kidpower will show you how to teach your young adults to effectively advocate for themselves in a healthy way, and know the difference between right and wrong. They have many creative ways of doing this. The situations that these young adults face on a daily basis can be as big as physical and sexual abuse in the home, or a time when they are bullied on a bus ride home. What these kids need is somebody to guide them and teach ways to be confident in themselves to say what they want and need, and protect themselves along with their peers. We believe Kidpower would be a great asset to your youth camps, and could help you build a very strong and well-liked curriculum to help your kids be successful and safe.",.,1.0,Ref?,Ref?,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,REQUESTED,ASKING_DETAILS,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-08-03,14:44:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Requested, Level 2: Asking Details, Level 3: Not Explicit, Level 4: None (or potentially Add, if the context is asking for a reference to be added.

The mental interference is the most common result of cyber bullying. The mental interference is the most common result of cyber bullying and may develop anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, emotional disorders, and substance abuse (Hemphill, Kotevski and Heerde, 2015). The most common health manifestation of cyberbullying is depression (Perren, Dooley, Shaw & Cross, 2010).Depression is usually accompanied by anxiety and results from erosion of self-confidence and self-esteem. Depression coupled with fear results into the increased feeling of loneliness and sadness, altered sleeping patterns, altered eating patterns and social withdrawal (Bonanno & Hymel, 2013). The magnitude of depression depends on upon the nature of bullying encountered and the number of the activities they do on the internet. Studies have shown that students who are intimidated individually or in a group are more likely to be overwhelmed severely (Bonanno & Hymel, 2013).Several studies have shown that students who are intimidated individually or in a group are more likely to be overwhelmed severely (Bonanno & Hymel, 2013). The consequences of bullying in the workplace, school or the internet have long-term effects on victims because they cause the social, psychological and emotional effect. Extreme cases can lead to withdrawal from school, chronic absenteeism, quitting a job or homicide at work. Educators, HR's and parents should intervene in incidents of bullying as failure to do so will imply they support bullying. The impact of a witnessing bystander to take action is communication in itself that sends a message to the bully. The potential of a group influence can be used positively to help individuals under a bullying circumstance by choosing to intervene as opposed to remaining silent. Sense making is vital in issues such as bullying because a person's interpretation of the situation can be done through communication with others. Therefore, strengthening communication will reduce bullying because communication is a management strategy that can deal with bullying at all levels. Relevant training should be carried out to enforce policies that do not tolerate traumatizing communication, and that warns about bullying. Communication should be encouraged and anonymous avenues to report bullying in the workplace and at school availed to ensure every complaint is reported and seriously investigated. Relevant measures such as strengthening communication, training internet users about internet ethics and enforcing policies that warn about bullying at all levels could help to reduce bullying. It is our obligation to ensure that we kill cyberbullying in the society.",,1.0,Inserted: a,Inserted: a,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add"

The additional comparison with the Stockholm and Rotterdam conventions further reinforces the need for improved clarity, implying changes to incorporate this distinction.  While adding clarifying information (""Add"") is a possibility, the primary goal seems to be revising the existing unclear language, making ""Change"" a more likely modification action.  The open questions make this a ""Potential Change,"" not a confirmed or executed one."

The processes are useful [1] and have recently received  significant attention. Amongst the various oxidation techniques known, catalytic oxidation appears to be a promising field of study. It is effective for the near-ambient degradation of pollutants as it holds promise of nearly complete degradation [2]. Zhou et al. [3] point out to the interest  in the development of copper-based heterogeneous catalysts, especially hydrotalcite-like compounds. These compounds, referred to as layered double hydroxides, are classes of layered materials and have received increasing attention owing to diverse applications, especially in catalysis.

This comment provides feedback on the presented data, highlighting numerical discrepancies and offering alternative figures based on different definitions.  This is providing information related to the content and strongly suggests a potential need to *change* the existing data or at least add clarifying information. The concluding note about the impact of definitions emphasizes this potential need for modification to ensure accuracy. While the comment doesn't explicitly request a change, it highlights inconsistencies that likely require correction. ""Change"" is the more probable Level 4 action, but ""None"" is possible if the existing data is ultimately deemed correct after considering the provided feedback."

OPTIONAL: Direct payments by KCE to Collaborators

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree that KCE shall directly pay - after having checked with the Contractor that the work was performed as planned (subject and limited to the agreed upon Study budget and/or the amounts set forth herein) - the invoices issued by the following Collaborators:

Payment schedule II [ ]

Payment schedule III [ ]


To ensure the direct payment to these Collaborators by KCE in accordance with the above, Contractor commits to include in the relevant agreement with the Collaborator the obligation for said Collaborator to directly issue its invoices in the name of KCE (subject to the timelines and conditions set forth in Section 3.2 of this Agreement) and to send these invoice to the address set out in Section 3.2 of this Agreement, it being understood that Contractor must make sure that each relevant Collaborator first submits a draft of any such invoice to Contractor for its prior approval.  Contractor also commits to immediately forward any invoices received from a relevant Collaborator to KCE should said Collaborator fail to send its invoices directly to KCE.

KCE only commits to pay the relevant Collaborator’s invoices to the extent that these are within the agreed upon budget and subject to the applicable timelines and/or milestones. Contractor shall remain responsible for the payment of any amounts that would exceed said budget.

For the avoidance of doubt, the abovementioned arrangements shall be without prejudice to Section 2.3.1 of this Agreement and Contractor’s responsibility for any acts and omissions by any of its Collaborators.",75.0,For illustration purposes only – to be adapted on a case-by-case basis.,For illustration purposes only – to be adapted on a case-by-case basis.,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,0.0,5.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,REQUESTED,CONTENT,EXPLICIT,ADD,2018-01-31,10:23:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Provided, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Change (or None, if no adaptation is needed for a specific case.

This comment provides context, stating the content is for illustrative purposes and should be adapted as needed. It's primarily providing information related to the content's usage.

In conclusion, bullying is a widespread problem facing both adolescents and adults. The consequences of bullying in the workplace, school or the internet have long-term effects on victims because they cause the social, psychological and emotional effect. Extreme cases can lead to withdrawal from school, chronic absenteeism, quitting a job or homicide at work. Educators, HR's and parents should intervene in incidents of bullying as failure to do so will imply they support bullying. The impact of a witnessing bystander to take action is communication in itself that sends a message to the bully. The potential of a group influence can be used positively to help individuals under a bullying circumstance by choosing to intervene as opposed to remaining silent. Sense making is vital in issues such as bullying because a person’s interpretation of the situation can be done through communication with others. Therefore, strengthening communication will reduce bullying because communication is a management strategy that can deal with bullying at all levels. Relevant training should be carried out to enforce policies that do not tolerate traumatizing communication, and that warns about bullying. Communication should be encouraged and anonymous avenues to report bullying in the workplace and at school availed to ensure every complaint is reported and seriously investigated. Relevant measures such as strengthening communication, training internet users about internet ethics, and enforcing policies that warn about bullying at all levels could help to reduce bullying. It is our obligation to ensure that we kill cyberbullying in the society.",,1.0,Inserted: the,Inserted: the,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add"

Dalton-Tingler,"It is appropriate to note important caveats governing the Phase I work product.  At the outset, the EIPC effort was designed to provide high-level analysis of possible transmission buildouts associated with hypothetical future scenarios.  The inputs to this process resulted from a substantial negotiation among diverse stakeholder interests spanning nearly the entire Eastern Interconnection.  It was not intended to restrict these inputs to the bottom-up regional planning inputs that are used to produce actionable transmission plans.  The intent was to provide stakeholders and policy makers, within the limitations of the scope of this project, with an advance view of possible impacts that could result from policy decisions under consideration now and in the future.  The end product of the effort will be a high-level interconnection-wide transmission analysis to be considered as appropriate in policy making and regional planning.  The scenarios presented by the stakeholders are, by definition, high-level and hypothetical.  The actual impact of any of the scenarios on a regional or sub-regional basis will depend on the exact circumstances and could be significantly affected by local conditions, events or policies which are simply not capable of being modeled given the high-level focus of the stakeholder-derived interconnection-wide futures.",appropriate,1.0,"Is everyone ok with this word, or should the analysis be considered informational in policy making and planning?","Is everyone ok with this word, or should the analysis be considered informational in policy making and planning?",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,REQUESTED,ASKING_DETAILS,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2011-12-08,15:51:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Requesting Confirmation, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Change (or None, depending on the answer and whether a rewording is needed.

Confidence helps in almost every aspect of one’s day, and can help get somebody through challenges they face. Kidpower is a wonderful program that makes curriculum programs useful for groups of people whether it is a school, agency, or even just parents to follow. Kidpower helps kid to be confident in advocating for themselves in any situation needed, and to know the major flags of safety. When working with children ages fourteen through twenty one, approaches need to be taken differently, than when dealing with children at the age of five or younger. There is research and proof that Kidpower truly does make a difference; their website states that about thirty-one percent of children show that their knowledge of safety has improved over three months (Van der Zande, 1). Kidpower will show you how to teach your young adults to effectively advocate for themselves in a healthy way, and know the difference between right and wrong. They have many creative ways of doing this. The situations that these young adults face on a daily basis can be as big as physical and sexual abuse in the home, or a time when they are bullied on a bus ride home. What these kids need is somebody to guide them and teach ways to be confident in themselves to say what they want and need, and protect themselves along with their peers. We believe Kidpower would be a great asset to your youth camps, and could help you build a very strong and well-liked curriculum to help your kids be successful and safe.","We believe Kidpower would be a great asset to your youth camps, and could help you build a very strong and well-liked curriculum to help your kids be successful and safe.",1.0,Same as above…,Same as above…,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,KEEP,SOCIAL COMMUNICATION,DISCUSSION,THREAD,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-08-03,14:48:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Provided, Level 2: Reference, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: None

CMMs with catch or effort limits. Non-compliance with such CMMs would undermine the conservation and management of the resource, which would have impacts on economic development opportunities and food security for coastal States; 
CMMs with closed areas or prohibitions (e.g., FAD temporal/spatial closures; at-sea transshipment for purse seine vessels; shark finning, retention of certain shark species or whale shark encirclement); 
CCMs with specific procedures that are pre-requisites to allowing a particular activity (i.e., at-sea transshipment for longline, troll and other vessels); 
CCMs or decisions for data reporting, both for target and non-target species, including observer coverage requirements. Non-compliance with such CMMs would undermine the ability of the Commission to conduct stock assessments or other analyses, which would increase uncertainties in the scientific advice available to the Commission; and 
CMMs that have provisions where differing interpretations are impacting effective implementation of the CMM itself, and therefore could impact the conservation and management of the stock.

The poem opens bluntly with the speaker’s rather callous observation, “A toad the power mower caught.” The initial lack of sympathy is evident in the objective description given in the next few lines about the toad’s injury and movements. However, when the toad hides itself in the cineraria leaves, the speaker seizes on the symbolism and begins to exhibit some interest. He at least concludes that the toad will die in this “final glade” (6). In the second stanza, the physical death of the toad is depicted by the now curious speaker, who observes the flow of blood and the glazing eyes. Watching the stillness of the toad makes the speaker think that the toad is “attending...towards some deep monotone” (11). Impressed by this, the speaker reflects in the third stanza on the life that the toad is losing, “Amphibia’s empires” (14) which is as precious to it as life is to the speaker. Finally, all light dies out of the toad’s eyes, leaving the speaker alone on the lawn in “haggard daylight.” The transformation from neutral observer to melancholy philosopher is complete.",callous observation,1.0,This is a very important point—any reading of the poem that does not take into account the initial callousness of the speaker will have a hard time describing his transformation.,This is a very important point—any reading of the poem that does not take into account the initial callousness of the speaker will have a hard time describing his transformation.,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,SOCIAL COMMUNICATION,FEEDBACK,THREAD,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2015-12-02,09:04:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Provided, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: None

Regardless of the professional affiliation, or the context for learning, educational professionals have an obligation to deliver inclusive and accessible education.

Anti-inflammatory interventions, specifically anti-cytokine therapies, have been remarkably successful in several chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and most recently, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 2, 3. A landmark study in patients with myocardial infarction demonstrated that administration of a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1 (IL-1) β innate immunity pathway with Canakinumab every 3 months for 4 years led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo 2. The beneficial effect was observed with no reduction in lipid levels from baseline and hve advanced the “inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerotic CVD”2. These findings are highly relevant to the CKD population whom suffer from an accelerated atherosclerosis process. We have previously shown that short-term administration of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) effectively reduced systemic inflammatory markers and increased circulating levels of adiponectin in maintenance hemodialysis patients4, 5. We also reported that an intervention using an IL-1 trap reduced markers of systemic inflammation and vascular oxidative stress and improved endothelial function in patients with stage 3-4 CKD 6. Consideration to inhibit other inflammatory pathway are underway. Thus, the Million Veteran Program, a biobank from the Veterans administration recently revealed that a genetic variant that mimics the effect of an IL-6 blocker was associated with lower risk of CV disease, findings that have prompted randomized trials of IL-6 blockade in CKD 7.",stage 3-4 CKD,1.0,Please add estimated GFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73m2 in parentheses here,Please add estimated GFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73m2 in parentheses here,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,REQUESTED,CONTENT,EXPLICIT,ADD,1899-11-30,00:00:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Requested, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Explicit, Level 4: Add

Around 25% of the phenol was adsorbed onto the CMA-chitosan during a short retention time of 7 min (Figure 5); thereafter, the adsorption percentage remained almost unchanged up to a contact time of 105 min.

In general we should use Spatial as defined in the basic package.
In the BP you´ll find the following sample which makes sense:
<rim:Slot name=""http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial""

From these foreign bells which carry different cultures, we can tell the differences between oriental bells and occidental bells. The later ones are small at the top but large at the bottom, which look like horns; they are well-made with incredible techniques. However, the most important difference lies on sound. The occidental bell is heard by knocking the inner side with the tongue through swinging the pendulum, except for the bell in churches, which share the same sound system with oriental bell. The occidental bell is melodious, loud but clear, while the oriental bell, which is knocked by wood hammer from outside, is vigorous. Japan and South Korea also develop their own characters on bell art. After introducing Chinese bell culture, Japan’s bell making technology developed greatly, but they maintained their style and shape.

This comment instructs drafters to modify a section used when contractors interact with the public.  It requests them to add or modify requirements in the contractor's plan based on the specific work and interactions. It also asks to modify the ""updates"" section as needed.  This involves *changing* existing content based on specific needs, so ""Change"" is the most appropriate Level 4 action. ""Add"" is also plausible if it primarily involves adding new requirements, but ""Change"" is more encompassing. The instructions are explicit and detailed (""Asking Details"").  Since the modifications depend on the context of the work/interactions, this is a *potential* change, not a definite or executed one."

Like the animal, the warrior, to succeed in combat must respond without hesitation, instinctually.  This approach works well and is necessary on the field of battle, but at home it causes distinct sociological disadvantages with family, the law, the neighbors and oneself.

Evidence shows that most of the times the bully is within the social circle. However, due to lack of definitive proof, the victim is powerless. Cyberbullying is more frustrating to the person being bullied because one can never be sure if it is your next door neighbor or your closest friend who is bullying you. Unlike the other types of bullying, cyberbullying is a permanent form of bullying because once something posted on the internet, it remains accessible to all people at any time. Besides, social network platforms are familiar places where disclosure of private information, posting of abusive comments and spread of false rumor is rampant. When teenagers and adults alike spend more time on the internet, they are more acceptable to cyberbullying due to the excessive exposure to cyber bullies. The current situation will remain the same because as the new technology emerges, more sophisticated threats of online bullying emerge (Erdur-Baker, 2010).",,1.0,"Inserted: ,","Inserted: ,",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add

This comment points out that the experimental description assumes the reader has a background in organic chemistry, suggesting it might be unclear to a general audience. It also notes that the actual amounts used might differ from those listed in a table. The feedback about assumed knowledge implies a potential need for *adding* further explanation or context to make the description accessible to a broader audience.

The lack of a specific instruction and the indirect suggestion for improvement make this a ""Potential Change,"" not a definite or executed modification.

However, although it has been established since the beginning, credit risk could be the cause of other risks such as liquidity risk which can end up being a financial distress. At that time, the financial distress condition can affect more widely to the cessation of the bank's business. If the bank's business is stalled, then there will be a risk of losses either from the side of the bank's shareholders, bank employees because there will be a massive layoff of employees, and customers who feel the loss of confidence in the ability of banks.  As mentioned above, if financial distress occurs in the bank, it will lose money to cover its expenses.

The 10 to 20 participants will be students in higher education. Participants will be recruited from a local university. The current study will involve purposeful sampling. The criteria for participation in the study will be that the participants be students in higher education, and be willing to do meditation for 10 minutes a day before the online activity, 4 days a week for 8 weeks. Eight weeks is the amount of time involved in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program at the University of Massachusetts Center for Mindfulness. Research showed that doing the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction meditation for 8 weeks showed differences in parts of the brain connected with sense of self, memory, stress and empathy (Hölzel, Carmody, Vangel, Congleton, Yerramsetti, Gard, & Lazar, 2011), and  suggested that the 8 weeks of mindfulness training was related to changes in grey matter in parts of the brain related to memory, learning, taking other perspectives and regulating emotion (Hölzel, Carmody, Vangel, Congleton, Yerramsetti, Gard, & Lazar, 2011). The participants may or may not have experience with meditation, but need to be willing to participate in the intervention of learning simple meditation in an online format. Before learning meditation the participants need to participate in a 30 minute phone interview. After the 8 weeks, the participants will participate in a final 30 minute phone interview related to meditation and critical thinking.

EngServe is calculated annually by the Vice-President (Operations) and will apply from Sept 1st - August 30th. All efforts should be made to calculate the EngServe charges before the services and corporate initiatives create their budgets.
The new EngServe agreement must be signed by the Vice-President (Operations) and the individual(s) responsible for the service/corporate initiative before it is deemed valid. 
Once the agreement is signed, EngServe will be paid automatically by the bookkeeper to the Engineering Society monthly.
EngServe will include HST where appropriate, as determined by a chartered accountant.
The EngServe rate for each service and corporate initiative is determined as follows:
Rent; based on the individual space usage of each group and collected to recoup the utility charges, as determined in the Engineering Society Lease with Queen’s University.
Phone; based on the number of phones and lines used by each group.
Administration; a proportional amount of the General Manager’s costs, based on the estimated time spent with each group.

This selection was unexpectedly difficult despite the fact the SSC reached consensus on September 26, 2011 regarding the three scenarios and using the remaining sensitivities to refine these scenarios.  The difficulties stemmed from anomalous results in locating a preponderance of wind in Indiana.  There were also concerns about the location of natural gas CTs and CCs.  While the CTs were only used for resource adequacy ensuring adequate capacity at the time of the coincident peak, there was a concern that all of the natural gas units were being built in areas that were not realistic.  There was agreement that the model selected the location based on very minor cost differences rather than being based on the entire range of factors that would be considered by resource and transmission planners.  As a result, the SSC requested the Midwest ISO to use the results of their Regional Generation Outlet Study (RGOS) as a means of distributing the CTs, CCs, and wind in a more realistic manner.",,1.0,This is also already in section 2.6 – almost verbatim.,This is also already in section 2.6 – almost verbatim.,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,PROVIDED,REFERENCE,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2011-12-08,15:51:00,"Level 0: Information Exchange, Level 1: Feedback, Level 2: Reference, Level 3: Potential Change, Level 4: Delete (or None, if the redundancy is acceptable.

They are security developments with designated perimeters, usually walls or fences, and controlled entrances that are intended to prevent penetration by nonresidents” (2). These authors contend that gated communities should be viewed as part of an effort by upper-income Americans to separate themselves from the poor and other perceived negative conditions of urban American life. Gated communities, they argue, are visible symbols of a campaign for separation that includes other tools as well. “Gates, fences, and private security guards, like exclusionary land-use policies, development regulations, and an assortment of other planning tools, are means of control, used to restrict or limit access to residential, commercial, and public spaces” (2). They “exist to wall out crime or traffic or strangers as well as to lock in economic position. Greater control over the neighborhood is presumed to mean greater stability in property values” (154). The authors argue that the boom in gating that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s was a response to increasing diversity, particularly in suburbia.

In conclusion, bullying is a widespread problem facing both adolescents and adults. The consequences of bullying in the workplace, school or the internet have long-term effects on victims because they cause the social, psychological and emotional effect. Extreme cases can lead to withdrawal from school, chronic absenteeism, quitting a job or homicide at work. Educators, HR's and parents should intervene in incidents of bullying as failure to do so will imply they support bullying. The impact of a witnessing bystander to take action is communication in itself that sends a message to the bully. The potential of a group influence can be used positively to help individuals under a bullying circumstance by choosing to intervene as opposed to remaining silent. Sense making is vital in issues such as bullying because a person’s interpretation of the situation can be done through communication with others. Therefore, strengthening communication will reduce bullying because communication is a management strategy that can deal with bullying at all levels. Relevant training should be carried out to enforce policies that do not tolerate traumatizing communication, and that warns about bullying. Communication should be encouraged and anonymous avenues to report bullying in the workplace and at school availed to ensure every complaint is reported and seriously investigated. Relevant measures such as strengthening communication, training internet users about internet ethics, and enforcing policies that warn about bullying at all levels could help to reduce bullying. It is our obligation to ensure that we kill cyberbullying in the society.",,1.0,Inserted: e th,Inserted: e th,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,MODIFICATION,EXECUTION,DONE,,,2016-05-24,10:09:00,"Level 0: Modification, Level 1: Execution, Level 2: Content, Level 3: Not Potential Change, Level 4: Add

The data collected through this study will be used to understand how students in the English Language Teaching Department make decisions and how this relates to their reflective thinking. If you agree to participate, we will be observing you during your class hours for four (4) weeks. The observations will be recorded by the researchers via hand-written notes. We will also arrange interview sessions at the end of each week. During these interview sessions, you will be asked to comment on the way you provided responses to questions during classroom discussions.

However, the definition of risk in Islamic banks may vary, depending on the application or discipline that discusses it. The risk in Islamic banks can also have different connotations and suggest different meanings for various fields. For example, in microeconomics, the risk refers to the uncertainty of the consequences (positive or negative) of a decision. Meanwhile, for the field of financial economics, risk connotation is negative, as it refers to potential losses. While there is ambiguity surrounding the definition of the word risk, the definition can still be used to consider the possibility of a risky situation in the Islamic bank, to identify or predict future situations in the Islamic bank's business activities, and the ability to specify each of the probabilities of the occurrence of risk in Islamic banks. In Islam, there has distinguished two different forms of risk in business activities.

Advisors are encouraged to use more creative ways of scheduling meetings and raising awareness throughout the student population, and student members would be encouraged to network with school staff members who may be interested in the FCAA. Furthermore, when advertising for a FCAA sponsored club, advisors should be more diligent in promoting benefits not only on a personal level to the students, but what their work could do to help the community and children in need through awareness, education, and action.",most students did not participate in a club,1.0,Will always be the case…question is what happens to those who do?

This comment poses a question about a specific scenario (""what happens to those who do...?"") and encourages further investigation (""Keep digging...""). This is a request for information (""Asking Details"").  While the answer might eventually lead to adding information to the document, no specific change is explicitly requested at this stage. It's primarily focused on gathering more information, and it's not clear what should be done with that information once found (hence, ""Not Explicit"").  Therefore, ""None"" is the most appropriate Level 4 action for now."

Because the demand response, energy efficiency, and distributed generation could not be chosen internally by the model, the deployment levels of these resources were specified external to the model by the stakeholders.  The default assumptions were also reviewed and EISPC provided detailed information on the states’ demand response/energy efficiency goals for consideration.  Because load growth and economic output are directly coupled in MRN through the autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI) parameter, the equilibration between MRN and NEEM (described below) was not performed in Futures 4 and 8, where the deployment of energy efficiency exceeded BAU levels.  In these futures, the MRN outputs were frozen at the analogous low-energy efficiency Futures 1 and 2, respectively, so that demand-side resources would not be mischaracterized as reductions in gross domestic product (GDP).",below,1.0,Where?,Where?,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,REQUESTED,ASKING_DETAILS,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2011-12-08,15:51:00,Error

Jill Norvilitis at The State University in New York looks at the importance of academic clubs in a 2000 study. The study states that Universities offer many research opportunities for students, but the majority will not undergo through these programs by the time of graduation. Instead, Norvilitis advocates the importance of college- run clubs that would promote group projects organized and ran by a club president. An experienced club president would then organize an academic project that members could research and complete. This would offer an alternative to research programs run by professors and labs that students may not sign up for either because they were not accepted or because they felt intimidated. For the study, 13 students were selected for a research study with one student serving as the president. For their research project, the students created a questionnaire comparing students who chose to have their marrow typed and those who did not. The students then mailed out the surveys and conducted a presentation to other college students. Following the project, the students were given a questionnaire to judge how they felt about the club. Results showed that students generally had a positive view on the club, and that they felt it benefitted them and made them grow academically (Norvilitis 2000). Aside from academics, it is common to find clubs based on other hobbies and interests such as sports, religion, activism, and more.",.,1.0,Ref?,Ref?,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,REQUESTED,ASKING_DETAILS,POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2013-08-02,14:01:00,Error

As Gary James lists, online courses have, “Extendibility, accessibility, and suitability, cross platform, ease of content update, and travel cost and time savings” (Advantages section). For those students who have a panic attack when an assignment isn’t graded in day, FLVS provided instant updates. Even though the teachers have work hours, they are still available for contact after hours, and if not, they usually respond within a day or so. What every student loves to hear is that an assignment can be submitted multiple times. Not only that, there are hardly any set due dates, and a student can work at his or her own pace. A student can also be idle in a class for up to two weeks before they get an angry e-mail from his or her teacher. FLVS can take the stress out of any class. But, as James also points out, nothing is perfect. There are many browser and bandwidth imitations and he asked the question, “Are computers replacing human contact?” (Disadvantages section). While taking my classes, what I experienced was that FLVS was more of doing homework than taking an actual class. For Algebra II, I would click on the assignment, read the examples, and then do the homework assignment. It gets difficult because although the teacher is available throughout the day, I could either e-mail him or e-mail him. And the line was always busy or he would take a day to respond to the e-mail. So not wanting to wait, I was sometimes left to teach myself how to do the problems. I knew it wasn’t a bad thing to learn how to accomplish the task by myself but in a subject like math I always found it useful to have someone to guide me and teach me shortcuts and other helpful tips. I repeated this cycle throughout the course while also forcing myself to muster up the motivation to type FLVS into the URL box instead of Tumblr or Facebook. I learned that FLVS was like a movie compared to its trailer. A trailer usually raises the expectations of a movie as the advantages of FLVS do. It is advertised that the teacher is available for about twelve hours every day, excluding Sunday. But in reality, a student still has to wait days for a response. A student is left to teach him or her self because unlike in public school, the student doesn’t see a teacher five times a week, so by the time the teacher and student stop playing phone tag, the student has resorted to Google to answer a question. So, a student should consider the underlying implications of the advantages of FLVS and the fact that first impressions aren’t always reliable.",Disadvantages section,1.0,(same as above),(same as above),0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,KEEP,INFORMATION EXCHANGE,PROVIDED,REFERENCE,NOT_POTENTIAL_CHANGE,,2012-01-25,19:22:00,Error
