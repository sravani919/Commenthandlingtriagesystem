# Dataset: Triage System Comments with Priority and Labels

## Overview
The `triaged_comments_with_priority_and_labels_hierarchy.csv` dataset is the output of a custom-built triage system that prioritizes and categorizes comments in collaborative environments. The dataset integrates insights from machine learning models, including GEMMA-2B for intent classification, Hugging Face models for sentiment analysis, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. 

The dataset is designed to enhance feedback management by scoring and categorizing comments across multiple dimensions, such as urgency, importance, sentiment, actionability, resolution status, and thematic relevance.

## Purpose
This dataset aims to provide a structured representation of comments in collaborative tools, facilitating their automated prioritization and classification. It can be used for:
- Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Development of triage systems for collaborative environments.
- Exploring hierarchical comment classification and prioritization strategies.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models.

## Column Descriptions
| Column Name                  | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `comment_id`                 | Unique identifier for each comment.                                                               |
| `comment_text`               | Text content of the comment.                                                                      |
| `urgency_score`              | Urgency level score (e.g., Immediate = 5, Anytime = 2).                                           |
| `importance_score`           | Importance level score based on comment type (e.g., Modification = 6).                            |
| `sentiment_score`            | Sentiment analysis score (e.g., Positive = 1, Neutral = 3, Negative = 5).                         |
| `actionability_score`        | Actionability score based on keywords or inferred next steps (e.g., "must," "need").              |
| `resolution_status`          | Current resolution status of the comment (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Resolved).                  |
| `lda_topic`                  | Dominant thematic topic identified by LDA (e.g., Project Management, Data Presentation).          |
| `lda_weight`                 | Thematic relevance weight assigned by LDA for prioritization.                                     |
| `priority_score`             | Final priority score calculated by aggregating scores across dimensions.                          |
| `triage_label`               | Assigned triage category (e.g., High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority, Informational).     |
| `level_0` to `level_4`       | Hierarchical labels representing broader to specific categories of the comment.                   |
| `metadata_columns`           | Additional metadata about the comment (e.g., author, timestamp, document ID).                     |

## Usage Instructions
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset into a data analysis environment like Python, R, or Excel.
   - Use column descriptions to filter or explore specific dimensions of interest.

2. **Research and Development**:
   - Train machine learning models on the hierarchical labels (`level_0` to `level_4`).
   - Use the `priority_score` to evaluate or benchmark triage algorithms.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Create plots to analyze the distribution of scores and triage labels.
   - Use LDA topics (`lda_topic`) to identify trends in comment themes.

4. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Test new comment classification models using the provided labels.
   - Cross-validate with additional datasets to generalize results.
